# This code originates from IJG and is adapted to handle both 8- and 12-bits JPEG
# "on the fly". (The original code needs to be compiled for 8 OR 12 bits.)
# NOTE: Adaption to 8/12-bits is NOT worked out for all functions!
#       Tested only for jpeg-read (restart marker change).
#       PGM write is also adapted, so at least translating JPEG 8/12 bits 
#       into PGM 8/12 bits should work.
#
# Makefile is suitable for both Linux and Windows compile, using GNU gcc.
# A lib-file (Linux) or dll (Windows) is created.
# Usage for Linux compile: make -f makefile.ansi 
# Usage for Windows compile: make -f makefile.ansi all_win

# 2004: Removed warning message which pops up during decoding MSG JPEG.

# From the README file of the Independent JPEG Group:
#
# "This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
# and transcoding.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color
# and gray-scale images.
# ....
# We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
# Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
# We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
# product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
# We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
# anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.
#
# For more information, contact jpeg-info@jpegclub.org."
